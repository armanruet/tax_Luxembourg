## üîß **QR Code Issue Fixed!**

I've identified and resolved the QR code problem. The issue was that the QR codes were pointing to other applications running on your system instead of the Luxembourg Tax Simulator.

### üöÄ **Solution Implemented:**

1. **Fixed QR Code URLs**: Updated the component to generate correct local URLs
2. **Added QR Test Page**: Created `/qr-test` page to verify QR functionality  
3. **Improved Debugging**: Added URL display to see exactly what the QR codes contain
4. **Multiple Scenarios**: Including a test mode for easy verification

### üì± **How to Test the QR Codes:**

#### **Step 1: Access the Application**
The Luxembourg Tax Simulator is now running at:
```
http://localhost:3003
```

#### **Step 2: Test QR Code Functionality**
1. **Open** `http://localhost:3003` in your browser
2. **Look for** the QR Code section on the homepage
3. **Select** "QR Code Test" from the dropdown (this is the first option)
4. **Scan** the QR code with your phone camera
5. **Verify** it takes you to a success page instead of the login screen

#### **Step 3: Test Tax Scenarios**
After confirming the QR test works:
1. **Switch** to one of the tax scenarios (‚Ç¨70k + ‚Ç¨20k, etc.)
2. **Scan** the new QR code
3. **Verify** it takes you to the tax calculator with pre-filled values

### üîç **Debugging Features Added:**

- **URL Display**: Each QR code now shows the exact URL it contains
- **Test Mode**: Special test page to verify QR scanning works
- **Direct Links**: Click links to test without QR scanning
- **Better Error Handling**: Proper loading states and error detection

### üì± **Expected QR Code URLs:**

- **Test Page**: `http://localhost:3003/qr-test`
- **Tax Simulator**: `http://localhost:3003/tax-simulator?income1=70000&income2=20000`

### üéØ **What Should Happen Now:**

1. ‚úÖ QR codes point to **localhost:3003** (your tax app)
2. ‚úÖ **No more login screens** from other apps
3. ‚úÖ **Direct access** to tax simulator with pre-filled scenarios
4. ‚úÖ **Mobile-optimized** pages for phone scanning

The QR codes should now work correctly and take you to the Luxembourg Tax Simulator instead of that generic login page!

Try scanning the "QR Code Test" option first to verify everything is working properly.
